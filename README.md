# Spotify_Playlist_Data
* Using Python, with the SQL Alchemy and Pandas libraries I have connected to the spotify API using another library called Spotipy. 
* I have cleared out my personal "Client ID" and "Client Secret." These two strings come from a personal Spotify account and the data cannot be pulled without one. 
* I have added a user-input for the playlist string you would like to download into a pandas dataframe.
* There is also an export-to-SQL line that exports the pandas dataframe to a local db. My localdb is in there, but feel free to set up your own.
* The local db I use is through SSMS (sql server management studio).
